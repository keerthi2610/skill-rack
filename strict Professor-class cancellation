In a college ,  a professor is strict and mandates that at least M students out of the total N students must arrive on time to his class.Else he would cancel the class. The start time of the class is also passed as the input.The individual arrival time for N students is also passed as input in 24 hours format.

The program must print if the class was cancelled or not.

Example 1:

Input:
5 3
9:30
9:30 9:38 9:31 9:32 9:31
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
4 out of the students arrived late, which means only one arrived on time. As the professor has mandated 3 out of the 5 must arrive on time, the class was cancelled and hence Yes is printed as the output.

Program:
#Your code below
m , n = map(int,input().split())
x , y =map(int,input().split(":"))
l = list(map(str,input().split()))
k = []
c=0
for i in l:
    j = list(map(int,i.split(":")))
    k.append(j)
for i in k:
    for j in range(len(i)):
        if(i[j]<x):
            c = c+1
        if(i[j]==x):
            if(i[j+1]<=y):
                c=c+1
            break    
#print(c)
if(c>=n):
    print("No")
else:
    print("Yes")
