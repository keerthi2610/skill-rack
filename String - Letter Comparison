STRING - LETTERS COMPARISON ID:207


Two string values S1 and S2 are passed as input. The program must check if both S1 and S2 contain the same unique set of letters and print YES or NO. Assume all the letters (alphabets) are in smaller case.

Boundary Conditions:
Length of S1 is from 2 to 100
Length of S2 is from 2 to 100

Input Format:
First line will contain the string value of S1
Second line will contain the string value of S2

Output Format:
YES or NO depending on if both S1 and S2 contain the same set of unique letters.

IMPORTANT:

Please note that the output is CASE SENSITIVE. Hence print YES or NO  (instead of yes or no)


Sample Input/Output:

Example 1:
Input:
read
dear

Output:
YES

Explanation:
Both S1 and S2 are formed using the letters - a d e r


Example 2:
Input:
record
decoder

Output:
YES

Explanation:
Both S1 and S2 are formed using the letters - c d e o r


Example 3:
Input:
energy
synergy

Output:
NO

Explanation:
S2 has additional letters - s y in it.


PROGRAM:
#Your code below
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
j=0
k=0
if(len(s1)>=len(s2)):
    n = len(s1)
    for i in range(n):
        if(s1[i] not in s2):
            j=j+1
else:
    n = len(s2)
    for i in range(n):
        if(s2[i] not in s1):
            j=j+1
if(j>0):
    print("NO")
else:
    print("YES")
