Order by prime,odd and even
Posted on June 12, 2018
A set of number of size N which are separated by one or more spaces will be passed as input. The program should print the prime numbers first followed by odd numbers and finally even numbers. Each of these categories prime numbers, odd numbers and even numbers must be sorted in ascending order among themselves.The numbers which are prime must be excluded from the list of odd and even numbers(in case of even numbers only 2 is prime as well as even)

Example 1:

Input:
4 5 9 22 11 2 15
Output:
2 5 11 9 15 4 22

Program:
#This is without using sympy since sympy module cant be used in skillrack
l = list(map(int,input().split()))
a=[]
k=[]
h=[]
for i in l:
    c = 0 
    for j in range(1,i):
        if(i%j==0):
            c=c+1
    if(c==1):
        a.append(i)
for j in l:
    if(j not in a):
        if(j%2==0):
            k.append(j)
        else:
            h.append(j)
a.sort()
k.sort()
h.sort()
a.extend(h)
a.extend(k)
print(*a,sep=" ")


#This is the code i did using sympy(symbolic python equations) in anaconda.
import sympy.ntheory as nt
l = list(map(int,input().split()))
a=[]
k=[]
h=[]
for i in l:
    if(nt.isprime(i)):
        a.append(i)
for j in l:
    if(j not in a):
        if(j%2==0):
            k.append(j)
        else:
            h.append(j)
a.sort()
k.sort()
h.sort()
a.extend(h)
a.extend(k)
print(a)
