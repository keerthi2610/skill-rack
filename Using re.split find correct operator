An expression E is passed as an input to the program. The expression will contain three numbers A, B and C, one equal symbol and one of the mathematical operators + - * /
But the given mathematical operator is incorrect and hence the expression is not valid. Hence the program must identify the correct operator and print that as the output.


Input Format:
First line will contain the expression E

Output Format:
First line will contain the correct mathematical operator


Sample Input/Output:

Example 1:
Input:
5-4=20

Output:
*

Explanation:
Only 5 multiplied with 4 gives 20. Hence - must be replaced with *.


Example 2:
